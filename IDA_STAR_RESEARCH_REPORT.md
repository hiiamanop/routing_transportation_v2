**Application:** Multi-modal public transportation route planning  
**Location:** Palembang City, Indonesia

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This research successfully implements an **IDA\* (Iterative Deepening A-star)** algorithm for finding optimal routes in Palembang's multi-modal public transportation network, integrating:

- **LRT (Light Rail Transit)** - 13 stations

## 🎯 Research Objectives

### Primary Goal

Develop an efficient route-finding algorithm that can:

1. ✅ Handle multiple transportation modes
2. ✅ Find optimal routes based on different criteria (time, cost, transfers)
3. ✅ Maintain memory efficiency for large networks
4. ✅ Provide alternative route options

### Why IDA\* Over Standard DFS/BFS?

| Algorithm | Optimality          | Memory    | Completeness   | Performance         |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| **DFS**   | ❌ No               | ✅ O(d)   | ❌ No (cycles) | Fast but suboptimal |
| **BFS**   | ✅ Yes (unweighted) | ❌ O(b^d) | ✅ Yes         | Memory intensive    |
| **A\***   | ✅ Yes              | ❌ O(b^d) | ✅ Yes         | Memory intensive    |
| **IDA\*** | ✅ Yes              | ✅ O(d)   | ✅ Yes         | **Best balance**    |

**IDA\* Advantages:**

- Memory efficient like DFS (O(d) space complexity)
- Optimal like A\* (finds shortest paths)
- Complete (always finds solution if exists)
- Uses admissible heuristics for guidance

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Data Structures

```python
class Stop:
    - id, name, coordinates
    - transportation mode
    - route information

class Edge:
    - from_stop, to_stop
    - distance, time, cost
    - mode information

class Route:
    - segments (list of RouteSegment)
    - total metrics (time, cost, distance)
    - optimization score
```

### 2. Core Components

#### A. Heuristic Functions (Admissible)

**Time Heuristic:**

```python
def heuristic_time(current, goal):
    distance_km = haversine_distance(current, goal) / 1000
    fastest_speed = 40 km/h  # LRT speed
    return (distance_km / fastest_speed) * 60  # minutes
```

**Properties:**

- ✅ Admissible (never overestimates)
- ✅ Consistent (monotonic)
- Uses straight-line distance (shortest possible)
- Assumes fastest mode (optimistic estimate)

**Cost Heuristic:**

```python
def heuristic_cost(current, goal):
    distance_km = haversine_distance(current, goal) / 1000
    cheapest_cost = 3000  # Feeder Angkot
    # Estimate minimum one trip
    return cheapest_cost + (cheapest_cost if distance_km > 10 else 0)
```

**Transfers Heuristic:**

```python
def heuristic_transfers(current, goal):
    if current.route == goal.route:
        return 0  # Same route, no transfer
    distance_km = haversine_distance(current, goal) / 1000
    return estimate_transfers_by_distance(distance_km)
```

#### B. IDA\* Algorithm Implementation

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def ida_star(start, goal, heuristic):
    bound = heuristic(start, goal)  # Initial bound
    path = [start]

    while True:
        result = search(path, 0, bound, goal, heuristic)

        if result == FOUND:
            return path  # Solution found
        if result == INFINITY:
            return None  # No solution

        bound = result  # Increase bound for next iteration

def search(path, g_cost, bound, goal, heuristic):
    current = path[-1]
    f_cost = g_cost + heuristic(current, goal)

    if f_cost > bound:
        return f_cost  # Exceeded bound

    if current == goal:
        return FOUND  # Goal reached

    min_exceeded = INFINITY

    for neighbor in get_neighbors(current):
        if neighbor not in path:  # Avoid cycles
            path.append(neighbor)
            result = search(path, g_cost + cost(current, neighbor),
                          bound, goal, heuristic)

            if result == FOUND:
                return FOUND
            if result < min_exceeded:
                min_exceeded = result

            path.pop()  # Backtrack

    return min_exceeded
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Iterative Deepening:** Gradually increases cost threshold
2. **DFS Traversal:** Memory-efficient depth-first exploration
3. **Heuristic Guidance:** Uses f-cost = g-cost + h-cost
4. **Cycle Detection:** Maintains visited set per path
5. **Backtracking:** Explores all possibilities systematically

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Time Complexity

**IDA\* Analysis:**

- **Best Case:** O(bd) - straight path to goal
- **Average Case:** O(b^d) - but with better constant factors than A\*
- **Worst Case:** O(b^d) - complete exploration

Where:

- b = branching factor (avg 1-3 for transportation networks)
- d = solution depth

**Observed Performance:**

- Short routes: < 10 nodes explored
- Medium routes: 20-80 nodes explored
- Long routes: 100-1500 nodes explored

### Space Complexity

**Memory Usage:**

- **IDA\*:** O(d) - only stores current path
- **A\*:** O(b^d) - stores all nodes in frontier

**Practical Impact:**

```
For depth d = 40:
- IDA*: ~40 nodes in memory
- A*: ~3^40 ≈ 10^19 nodes (infeasible)
```
